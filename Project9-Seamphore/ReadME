Semaphores can eb thought of as number of available permits.
Wait and Notify has to be done by same thread.
But Semaphore can be acquired by any thread and can be released by any number of threads.

Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(10,true);  
//true is for fairness which ever thread calls acquire first will get it. 
If this paraameter is set to false then fairness is not guaranteed.
