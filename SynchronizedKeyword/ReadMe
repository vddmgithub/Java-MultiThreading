Here we have two threads who are trying yo increment the same variable.
Without JOIN
============
The result could be 0 at times becoz by the time these threads run the main thread could complete its execution 
leaving behind this 0.

If we were to have couple of thread joins...
Then the main thread waits till the other threads finishes off.

WAIT TOO FAILS
==============
Even though we may wait, the results will not guarantee correctness.
The issue is becoz of inherent nature of in the operation not being ATOMIC.

count++ ---> READ Count, Increment by 1, Store is back.
So this leads to INTERLEAVING OF THREADS.

VOLATILE too wont solve this issue.

So we should go with Synchronization.
