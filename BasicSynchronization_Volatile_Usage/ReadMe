Without Volatile this code may not work well on all systems.
Becoz for sake of achieving optimization there could be two copies of same variable.
So it may never get reflected with same value in both the threads.

So we need to have a volatile qualifier inorder to ensure each thread will have the updated value in the 
variable.
So this code works perfectly on all systems.
